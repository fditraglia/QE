Eight “regular” classes will take place in TT of your second year, and four revision classes will take place in HT of your third year. To keep my life simple, this document applies to all classes that take place in a given calendar year. In other words: the material listed below under classes applies to current second years while the material listed under revision classes applies to current third years."

During the revision classes I will go over past exam questions, focusing on those from the most recent years. A list of the problems I suggest that you prepare for each class follows below. I will take requests from these problems during my classes, emphasizing the more recent problems. Each class will begin with a quiz based on the associated course material for that class, so you should make sure to review in advance.\n\nLogistics: HT 2025\nThursdays of HT weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 from 2-4pm in the Paul Oster Room.\n\n\nPast Exam Solutions\nExam papers for 2014-2022 are posted on the QE canvas site, along with solutions for 2014-2020.
